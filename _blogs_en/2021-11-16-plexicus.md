We are pleased to announce that Puffin Security has been accepted to participate in Plexicus Cyber Security Marketplace

As one of the very first companies accepted, we are thrilled to be registered in the platform and soon to be able to quote for cyber security services. 

This is one of another multiple ways in which we are building the future, as traditional methods to hire cyber security experts are ever changing. 

At Puffin Security, we use the ELITE SECURITY CONSULTING methodology so you can rest assured that your organization will have the highest level of security. 

Complete the form, and we'll be in touch as soon as possible
